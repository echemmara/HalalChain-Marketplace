## **5. Deployment Guide**

### **5.1 Docker Setup**
1. Create a **Dockerfile** for frontend, backend, and AI agents:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:14
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN npm install
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   docker build -t halal-ecommerce-frontend .
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 halal-ecommerce-frontend
   ```

---

### **5.2 Kubernetes Orchestration**
1. Define Deployment:
   ```yaml
